Project 3 Interactive MERN Stack Single-Page Application
# PokemAn - Pokemon Trading Card Game Discussion Board
PokemAn is a MERN-stack single-page application that serves as a discussion board for the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Users can create an account, log in, and participate in discussions with other users. The application allows users to post questions, share tips and tricks, and discuss the latest news about the Pokémon Trading Card Game.

# Concept:
* As a Pokémon Trading Card Game enthusiast, I want to join an online community where I can discuss strategies, trade cards, and connect with other players. 

## Acceptance Criteria
* I want to be able to create an account, log in securely, and see a personalized dashboard with my activity history.
* I want some kind of sorted Pokémon directory that groups the Pokémon by region.
* I want to be able to browse and search through a variety of threads and participate in the conversation by commenting.
* I also want to be able to create my own threads and edit or delete my own posts. 
* I want the website to be mobile-friendly, easy to navigate, and visually appealing.
